## üìñ Project Overview

India's farmers are the backbone of our nation, yet they often face a critical information gap regarding market prices, crop health, and essential supplies. **Kisan Shakti** is an AI-powered web application designed to bridge this gap by consolidating essential tools into a single, easy-to-use platform for Indian farmers. As well as this is a  **functional prototype** of an AI-powered web application designed to empower Indian farmers. The primary goal of this project was to rapidly translate a product idea into an interactive application to showcase the user experience and validate the core concept.

Built entirely with the AI-assisted platform Lovable.ai, this project demonstrates the power of modern no-code tools to create and deploy high-fidelity prototypes in a fraction of the time required by traditional coding.

## üìä Project Status: Functional Prototype

It is important to note that this project is a **proof-of-concept** and not a full-scale production application.

* **Frontend & UX:** The user interface and user experience are the primary focus and are fully interactive.
* **Backend:** The application uses the integrated database from the Lovable.ai platform, sufficient for demonstration purposes.
* **AI Feature:** The AI Disease Detection feature currently demonstrates the intended user flow. The next step would be to integrate a live machine learning model to power its results.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **üìà Real-Time Market Prices:** Fetches and displays current crop prices from various markets, empowering farmers to make informed selling decisions.
* **üåø AI Crop Disease Detection:** Users can upload an image of a plant leaf, and the application leverages an AI model to identify potential diseases, offering a crucial first step in crop protection.
* **üõí Agricultural Supplies Marketplace:** A simple interface to browse and order essential supplies like seeds and fertilizers directly through the app.
* **‚òÄÔ∏è Localized Weather Forecasts:** Provides up-to-date weather information to help farmers plan their activities effectively.

## üí° Learnings & Future Scope

Developing the Kisan Shakti prototype was a valuable exercise in product development, user-centric design, and leveraging modern tools for rapid execution and and integrating multiple functionalities into
cohesive user experience.


**Future plans could include:**
* Integrating more regional languages.
* Adding a community forum for farmers to connect.
* Connecting to government agricultural APIs for richer data.
